    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>8 tablespoons (1 stick) salted butter</li>
      <li>1 large (or 2 medium) yellow onion, diced</li>
      <li>6 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>½ tablespoon ginger, minced</li>
      <li>
        3 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into bite-size pieces
      </li>
      <li>4 teaspoons garam masala, divided</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon turmeric</li>
      <li>1½ teaspoons seasoned salt, divided</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)</li>
      <li>1 (14.5-ounce) can diced tomatoes, with their juices</li>
      <li>
        1 cup unsweetened coconut milk (it should be thin like water and not
        thick and lumpy)
      </li>
      <li>½ cup Greek yogurt</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
      <li>1 (6-ounce) can tomato paste</li>
      <li>½ cup heavy cream</li>
      <li>Fresh cilantro, for serving</li>
      <li>Naan, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place the butter in the Instant Pot, then hit Saute and Adjust so it's
        on the High or More setting.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the butter's melted, add the onion, garlic, and ginger and sauté
        for 5 minutes, until softened and beginning to brown slightly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the chicken and saute until the edges are pinkish-white in color,
        but not yet fully cooked, 2-3 minutes. Add the paprika, 3 teaspoons
        garam masala, cumin, turmeric, ½ teaspoon seasoned salt, and cayenne (if
        using) and sauté, stirring, for another minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in the diced tomatoes and coconut milk and top off with the Greek
        yogurt, but do not stir in the yogurt! Simply let it rest on top of
        everything else in the pot.
      </li>
      <li>
        Secure the lid, move the valve to the sealing position, and hit Keep
        Warm/Cancel followed by Manual or Pressure Cook on High Pressure for 8
        minutes. Quick release when done. Meanwhile, mix the cornstarch with 2
        tablespoons water to form a slurry. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in the tomato paste, cream, the remaining teaspoon of garam masala,
        and the remaining teaspoon of seasoned salt. Hit Keep Warm/Cancel
        followed by Sauté and Adjust so it's on More or High. Once bubbling,
        immediately stir in the cornstarch slurry and simmer for 30 seconds
        before hitting Keep Warm/Cancel to turn the pot off. Allow to sit for 5
        minutes to thicken.
      </li>
      <li>Serve with cilantro and naan, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
