        <p>Pho is probably the greatest noodle soup you can experience. Trouble is, the traditional method calls for hard-to-find ingredients and takes hours and hours to achieve that deep, layered flavor. This recipe is going to give you all of that flavor in under one hour.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <p>THE BROTH</p>
            <li>3 whole star anise</li>
            <li>5 whole cloves</li>
            <li>2 cinnamon sticks, broken in half</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1.5 pounds chicken tenderloins or boneless, skinless chicken thighs, thinly sliced so the pieces are 1/4 inch wide and about 2 inches long</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons fish sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced or pressed</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon crushed/minced ginger</li>
            <li>3 cups chicken broth</li>
            <li>3 cups beef broth</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons hoisin sauce</li>
            <li>8-16 ounces dried banh pho/pad thai rice noodles</li>
            <p>THE TOPPINGS</p>
            <li>1 yellow onion, thinly sliced into rings</li>
            <li>1 (14-ounce) can bean sprouts, drained</li>
            <li>Fresh cilantro leaves</li>
            <li>1 jalapeno pepper, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 lime, sliced into disks or cut into 6 wedges</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Place the star anise, cloves, and cinnamon sticks in the Instant Pot. Hit Sauté and Adjust so it’s on the More or High setting. Heat and toast the spices for 5 minutes, flipping midway through. When done, remove the spices from the pot, place in a bowl, and coarsely (not finely) crush with a mortar and pestle (or place between some dish towels or paper towels and pound with a mallet). Once crushed, secure the spices in a metal tea ball or spice bag. (NOTE: These spices are 100 percent crucial to the broth’s flavor—especially since we’re doing this pho the super shortcut route.)
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour the olive oil into the pot and allow it to heat for 3 minutes. Then add the onion strands for the topping and let them cook until they’re a beautiful brown and slightly charred color. Remove and set aside when done.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the chicken to the pot, immediately pouring the fish sauce and sesame oil over it and deglazing/scraping the bottom of the pot. Stir constantly until the chicken is coated and mostly white (about 2 minutes, and it’s okay if some is still pink—it shouldn’t be fully cooked yet).
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the garlic and ginger, stirring often for 1 minute and deglazing (scraping) the bottom of the pot with a mixing spoon.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the chicken broth, beef broth, and hoisin sauce and deglaze the bottom of the pot once more. Lastly, add in the locked tea ball with the crushed spices and the seasoned salt. Secure the lid, move the valve to the sealing position, hit Keep Warm/Cancel, and then hit Manual or Pressure Cook on High Pressure for 7 minutes. Perform a quick release when done, remove the tea ball (discard the spices), and stir in the seasoned salt.
            </li>
            <li>
                When ready to serve, add the rice noodles to the pot, stirring to break them up. Stir often, about 8 minutes, and the noodles should be cooked to the proper consistency by the heat of the broth.
            </li>
            <li>
                Ladle into large serving bowls. Top with some cooked onion, a few bean sprouts, some cilantro, a few jalapeño slices, and a lime wedge. You can also add whatever else makes you happy—that’s part of the beauty of a pho!
